# OWASP-10---Juice-Shop-Walkthrough

# Project Objective

The objective of the project was to conduct a walkthrough of the OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately insecure web application, using tools like Kali Linux and Burp Suite to perform penetration testing. The goal was to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities following the OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

# Tools 

- Kali Linux: Kali Linux is a powerful penetration testing distribution widely used by cybersecurity professionals. It comes pre-installed with numerous tools for various security - assessments, including network analysis, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation.
- Burp Suite: Burp Suite is a leading toolkit for web application security testing. It provides a comprehensive platform for manual testing and automated scanning of web applications, helping identify security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.

# Skills Gained

- Web Application Security Testing: Performing a walkthrough of the OWASP Juice Shop involved gaining hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting common web application vulnerabilities, such as injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and more. This skill is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to understand the methods attackers use to compromise web applications.
- Burp Suite Proficiency: Through this project, proficiency in using Burp Suite for web application security testing was developed. This includes configuring proxy settings, intercepting and modifying HTTP requests, analyzing responses, and utilizing various features such as the Scanner and Intruder modules. Mastering tools like Burp Suite is essential for effective and efficient vulnerability assessment and exploitation.
- Reporting and Documentation: Effective communication of findings is vital in cybersecurity. This project provided an opportunity to practice documenting discovered vulnerabilities, including their impact and remediation recommendations. Creating clear and concise reports is essential for stakeholders to understand and address security issues promptly.

# Outcomes 

- Identified multiple vulnerabilities within the OWASP Juice Shop application, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, insecure direct object references, and more.
- Successfully exploited vulnerabilities using Burp Suite to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, manipulate user sessions, and execute arbitrary code.
- Generated comprehensive reports detailing identified vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and recommended remediation measures.
